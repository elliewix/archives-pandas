# archives-pandas
A short lesson on pandas using an archival finding aid as the data.

## Who is this for?

This is a simple and short intro to pandas, designed for about an hour or two, using an archival finding aid as the example data.

This presumes that learners have had some exposure to Python and general prgramming vocubalary/concepts. Anyone who has completed a MOOC, one semester, or the equivalent of self study should be fine.  The pandas essay may be of more interest with those teaching pandas to python novices or those desiring more context.

Likewise, this presumes that you are not an expert with Python and looking for a master class. Read at your own risk of irritation at what I skip because you aren't my target audience.

This helps you avoid having to install stuff, but don't save anything there! It will go away. Take your notes elsewhere.

## Where's the stuff???

Activity 1: read through the long winded essay on the context of pandas in [whatispandas.md](whatispandas.md)

Nothing in this essay is meant as a dig on pandas or the pandas maintainer team.  This is a fantastic tool and the work is hard.  Any criticisms are meant to help novices understand things a bit better and can also be considered widely universal of all packages attempting to do what pandas does.  To any pandas maintainers/contributors who stumble across this:  thank you for all your hard work.

Activity 2: work through the code demo in [pandas_demo.ipynb](pandas_demo.ipynb)
